       Software as a Service or SaaS is a way of delivering applications over the Internet as a service. Also known as cloud software, ASP, on-demand software or hosted software. The first applications for consumers were things like webmail, bookmarking and photo sharing. In business, things like recruitment, expenses and customer relationship management were among the early innovations. SaaS has since become a widely-used business model with more and more different kinds of applications available via the cloud.

       CaaS is part of a larger category of services known as software as a service (SaaS), in which vendors offer software products and services over the Internet. It is also an alternative to the traditional model of buying and installing licensed software on site.

The core concept of CaaS is that accessing these services over the internet is extremely convenient. The client businesses do not have to worry about maintaining servers and connections, uploading different kinds of content or doing all of the administrative work involved in keeping a communications platform functional. Business users just sign in and use the services.
